Super 30 game

This is a simple Python program that allows you to play a number game against a computer. The goal of the game is to reach the number 30 without crossing it. Players take turns entering a sequence of consecutive numbers, and the player who reaches 30 without crossing it wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Run the program using Python.

2. You will be prompted to choose whether you want to play the game or quit. Type "Yes" to play or "No" to quit.

3. If you choose to play, you will have two options: to take the first chance or the second chance.

4. If you choose the first chance, you will start by entering a sequence of consecutive numbers, and then the computer will play. If you choose the second chance, the computer will start, and you will enter numbers after the computer's turn.

5. The game continues until one of the players reaches the number 30 without crossing it. If you cross 30, you lose the game.

6. The game will display the results, and you can choose to play again or quit.

## Game Rules

- Players take turns entering consecutive numbers.
- You can enter 1 to 3 consecutive numbers in each turn.
- The computer calculates its moves based on your input to make the game competitive.
- The first player to reach 30 without crossing it wins.

## How to Run

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can run the game by executing the `Super30.py` script.
